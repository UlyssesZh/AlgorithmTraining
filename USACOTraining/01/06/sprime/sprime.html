    <h1>Problem: Super Prime Rib</h1>
</div>

<p>Butchering Farmer John's cows always yields the best prime rib.  You
    can tell prime ribs by looking at the digits lovingly stamped across
    them, one by one, by FJ and the USDA.  Farmer John ensures that a
    purchaser of his prime ribs gets really prime ribs because when sliced
    from the right, the numbers on the ribs continue to stay prime right down to the last rib, e.g.:
<pre>
     7  3  3  1
</pre>
<p>The set of ribs denoted by 7331 is prime; the three ribs 733 are
    prime; the two ribs 73 are prime, and, of course, the last rib, 7, is
    prime.  The number 7331 is called a superprime of length 4.

<p> Write a program that accepts a number N 1 &lt;=N&lt;=8 of ribs and
    prints all the superprimes of that length.

<p> The number 1 (by itself) is not a prime number.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: sprime</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

A single line with the number N.

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file sprime.in) </h3>
