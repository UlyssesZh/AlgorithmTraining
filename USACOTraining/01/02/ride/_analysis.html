    <h1>Analysis: Your Ride Is Here</h1>
</div>

<p> This is probably the easiest problem in the entire set of
    lessons.  An `ad hoc' problem, no particular algorithms or tricks
    are needed save one:  one must be careful to get the input without
    processing the newline on the end!

<p> Here is a prototype solution:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;ctype.h&gt;

int
hash(char *s)
{
	int i, h;

	h = 1;
	for(i=0; s[i] &amp;&amp; isalpha(s[i]); i++)
		h = ((s[i]-'A'+1)*h) % 47;
	return h;
}

void
main(void)
{
	FILE *in, *out;
	char comet[100], group[100];  /* bigger than necessary, room for newline */

	in = fopen("input.txt", "r");
	out = fopen("output.txt", "w");

	fgets(comet, sizeof comet, in);
	fgets(group, sizeof group, in);

	if(hash(comet) == hash(group))
		fprintf(out, "GO\n");
	else
		fprintf(out, "STAY\n");
	exit (0);
}
</pre>

    <h3>Python Solutions</h3>

<p>Canada's Iain Found created this straightforward solution (which
    has been slightly modified to make the highest quality presentation here):
<pre>"""
LANG: PYTHON2
"""
with open('ride.in', 'r') as fin:
    comet1 = fin.readline().strip()
    comet2 = fin.readline().strip()
prod1, prod2 = 1, 1
for c in comet1: prod1 *= ord(c) - ord('A') + 1
for c in comet2: prod2 *= ord(c) - ord('A') + 1
with open('ride.out', 'w') as fout:
    if prod1 % 47 == prod2 % 47: fout.write('GO\n')
    else: fout.write('STAY\n')
</pre>

Note that a couple important features are included:
<ul>
    <li>Newlines are removed.</li>
    <li>The <b><tt>with</tt></b> construct automatically closes files upon the block
        exit.</li>
</ul>

<p>USACO alumnus Tyler Adams created this more
    functional-programming-oriented solution:
<pre>"""
LANG: PYTHON2
"""
def char_to_num(c):
    return ord(c) - ord('A') + 1

def line_to_code(s):
    nums = map(char_to_num, s)
    code = reduce(lambda x,y: x*y, nums) % 47
    return code

with open("ride.in", "r") as input_file:
    raw_lines = input_file.readlines()
lines = map(lambda s: s.strip(), raw_lines)
codes = map(line_to_code, lines)
should_go = codes[0] == codes[1]

with open("ride.out", "w") as output_file:
    if should_go: output_file.write("GO\n")
    else: output_file.write("STAY\n")
</pre>
Note the good choice of variable names in both of these Python solutions. Don't
miss that even though some lines could be combined, that compression is not
performed in interest of creating a program that is debuggable and maintainable.
