<div style="text-align: center"><h1>Problem: Cow Pedigrees</h1><b>Silviu Ganceanu -- 2003</b></div>
<p>Farmer John is considering purchasing a new herd of cows. In
	this new herd, each mother cow gives birth to two children. The
	relationships among the cows can easily be represented by one or
	more binary trees with a total of N (3 <= N < 200) nodes.  The trees
	have these properties:

<ul>
	<li>The degree of each node is 0 or 2. The degree is the count of
		the node's immediate children.</li>
	
	<li>The height of the tree is equal to K (1 < K < 100). The height
		is the number of nodes on the longest path from the root to any
		leaf; a leaf is a node with no children.</li> </ul>

<p>How many different possible pedigree structures are there?  A
	pedigree is different if its tree structure differs from that of
	another pedigree. Output the remainder when the total number of
	different possible pedigrees is divided by 9901.
