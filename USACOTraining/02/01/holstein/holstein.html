    <h1>Problem: Healthy Holsteins</h1>
    <b>Burch & Kolstad</b>
</div>

<p>Farmer John prides himself on having the healthiest dairy cows
    in the world. He knows the vitamin content for one scoop of each
    feed type and the minimum daily vitamin requirement for his cows.
    Help Farmer John feed the cows so they stay healthy while minimizing
    the number of scoops that a cow is fed.

<P>Given the daily requirements of each kind of vitamin that a cow
    needs, identify the smallest combination of scoops of feed a cow
    can be fed in order to meet at least the minimum vitamin requirements.

<P>Vitamins are measured in integer units. Cows can be fed at most
    one scoop of any feed type. It is guaranteed that a solution exists
    for all contest input data.

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Line 1: </td>
        <td>integer V (1 &lt;= V &lt;= 25), the number of types
            of vitamins </td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Line 2: </td>
        <td>V integers (1 &lt;= each one &lt;= 1000), the
            minimum requirement for each of the V vitamins that a cow requires each day
        </td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Line 3: </td>
        <td>integer G (1 &lt;= G &lt;= 15), the number of types
            of feeds available </td></tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Lines 4..G+3: </td>
        <td>V integers (0 &lt;= each one &lt;= 1000), the amount
            of each vitamin that one scoop of this feed contains. The first line of these G
            lines describes feed #1; the second line describes feed #2; and so on.

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The output is a single line of output that contains:
<ul>
    <li>the minimum number of scoops a cow must eat, followed by:
    <li>a SORTED list (from smallest to largest) of the feed types the cow is given
    </li></ul>
If more than one set of feedtypes yield a minimum of scoops, choose
the set with the smallest feedtype numbers.
