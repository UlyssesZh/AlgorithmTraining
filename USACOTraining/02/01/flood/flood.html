        <h3>Sample Problem: Connected Fields</h3>

            <p> Farmer John's fields are broken into fields, with paths between
                some of them. Unfortunately, some fields are not reachable from
                other fields via the paths.

            <p> Define a <i>superfield</i> as a collection of fields that are
                all reachable from each other. Calculate the number of superfields.

                <h3>The Abstraction</h3>

            <p> Given: an undirected graph

            <p> The <i>component</i> of a graph is a maximal-sized (though not
                necessarily maximum) subgraph which is connected.

            <p> Calculate the component of the graph.

                <br><img src="flood1.gif"><br>

                This graph has three components: {1,4,8}, {2,5,6,7,9}, and {3}.

                <h3>The Algorithm: Flood Fill</h3>

            <p> Flood fill can be performed three basic ways: depth-first,
                breadth-first, and breadth-first scanning. The basic idea is to
                find some node which has not been assigned to a component and to
                calculate the component which contains it. The question is how to
                calculate the component.

            <p> In the depth-first formulation, the algorithm looks at each
                step through all of the neighbors of the current node, and, for
                those that have not been assigned to a component yet, assigns them
                to this component and recurses on them.

            <p> In the breadth-first formulation, instead of recursing on the
                newly assigned nodes, they are added to a queue.

            <p> In the breadth-first scanning formulation, every node has two
                values: component and visited. When calculating the component, the
                algorithm goes through all of the nodes that have been assigned to
                that component but not visited yet, and assigns their neighbors to
                the current component.

            <p> The depth-first formulation is the easiest to code and debug,
                but can require a stack as big as the original graph. For explicit
                graphs, this is not so bad, but for implicit graphs, such as the
                problem presented has, the numbers of nodes can be very large.

            <p> The breadth-formulation does a little better, as the queue is
                much more efficient than the run-time stack is, but can still run
                into the same problem. Both the depth-first and breadth-first
                formulations run in N + M time, where N is the number of vertices
                and M is the number of edges.

            <p> The breadth-first scanning formulation, however, requires very
                little extra space. In fact, being a little tricky, it requires no
                extra space. However, it is slower, requiring up to N*N + M time,
                where N is the number of vertices in the graph.

                <h3>Pseudocode for Breadth-First Scanning</h3>

            <p>This code uses a trick to not use extra space, marking nodes to
                be visited as in component -2 and actually assigning them to the
                current component when they are actually visited.

                </pre>

            <p> Running time of this algorithm is O(<i>N <sup> 2</sup></i>),
                where <i>N</i> is the numbers of nodes. Every edge is traversed
                twice (once for each end-point), and each node is only marked once.

                <h3>Execution Example</h3>

            <p> Consider the graph from above.

                <br><img src="flood1.gif"><br>

            <p> The algorithm starts with all nodes assigned to no component.

            <p> Going through the nodes in order first node not assigned to
                any component yet is vertex 1. Start a new component (component 1)
                for that node, and set the component of node 1 to -2 (any nodes
                not shown are unassigned).

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <table>
                    <tr> <td align="center">Node</td> <td align="center">Component</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>1</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>-2</b></td> </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>Now, in the
                <tt>flood_fill</tt> code, the first time through the

                <tt>do</tt> loop, it finds the node 1 is assigned to component -2.
                Thus, it reassigns it to component 1, signifying that it has
                been visited, and then assigns its neighbors (node 4) to component -2.

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <table>
                    <tr> <td align="center">Node</td> <td align="center">Component</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>1</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>1</b></td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>4</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>-2</b></td> </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>As the loop through all the nodes continues, it finds that node 4
                is also assigned to component -2, and processes it appropriately
                as well.

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <table>
                    <tr> <td align="center">Node</td> <td align="center">Component</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">1</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>4</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>1</b></td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>8</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>-2</b></td> </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p> Node 8 is the next to be processed.

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <table border="1">
                    <tr> <td align="center">Node</td> <td align="center">Component</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">1</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">4</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>8</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>1</b></td> </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>Now, the
                <tt>for</tt> loop continues, and finds no more nodes
                that have not been assigned yet. Since the
                <tt>until</tt> clause is
                not satisfied (
                <tt>num_visited</tt> = 3), it tries again. This time,
                no nodes are found, so the function exits and component 1 is complete.

            <p> The search for unassigned nodes continues, finding node 2. A new
                component (component 2) is allocated, node 2 is marked as in component
                -2, and
                <tt>flood_fill</tt> is called.

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <table>
                    <tr> <td align="center">Node</td> <td align="center">Component</td> </tr>

                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>2</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>-2</b></td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">4</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">8</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>Node 2 is found as marked in component -2, and is processed.

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <table border="1">
                    <tr> <td align="center">Node</td> <td align="center">Component</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">1</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">2</td>  <td align="center">2</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">4</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>7</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>-2</b></td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">8</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>9</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>-2</b></td> </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>Next, node 7 is processed.

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <table border="1">
                    <tr> <td align="center">Node</td> <td align="center">Component</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">1</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">2</td>  <td align="center">2</td> </tr>

                    <tr> <td align="center"><b>7</b></td>  <td align="center"><b>2</b></td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">8</td>  <td align="center">1</td> </tr>
                    <tr> <td align="center">9</td>  <td align="center">-2</td> </tr>
                </table>
            </div>

            <p>Then node 9 is processed.

            <div style="text-align: center">
                <table border="1">

                    <tr> <td align="center">7</td>  <td align="center">2</td> </tr>

                </table>

            <p>The terminating condition does not hold (
                <tt>num_visited</tt> =
                3), so the search through for nodes assigned to component -2 starts
                again.  Node 5 is the first one found.

            <div style="text-align: center">

            <p> No more nodes are found assigned to component -2, but the terminating

            <p> From here, the algorithm eventually terminates, as there are no more
                nodes assigned to component -2 and no unassigned nodes.  The three
                components of the graph have been determined, along with the component
                to which each node belongs.

                <h3>Problem Cues</h3>

            <p> Generally, these types of problem are fairly clear. If it asks
                for sets of "connected" things, it's probably asking for components,
                in which case flood fill works very well. Often, this is a step in
                solving the complete problem.

                <h3>Extensions</h3>

            <p> The notion of "components" becomes muddied when you go to
                directed graphs.

            <p> However, the same flooding idea can be used to determine the
                points which are reachable from any given point even in a directed
                graph. At each recursive step, if the point isn't marked already,
                mark the point as reachable and recurse on all of its neighbors.

            <p> Note that to determine which points can reach a given point in
                a directed graph can be solved the same, by looking at every arc
                backwards.

                <h3>Sample Problems</h3>

                    <h5>Company Ownership [abridged, IOI 93]</h5>

            <p>Given: A weighted directed graph, with weights between 0 and 100.

            <p> Some vertex A "owns" another vertex B if:

            <ul>

                <li> A = B </li>

                <li> There is an arc from A to B with weight more than 50.</li>

                <li> There exists some set of vertices <i>C <sub> 1</sub></i>
                    through <i>C <sub> k</sub></i> such that A owns <i>C <sub> 1</sub></i>
                    through <i>C <sub> k</sub></i>, and each vertex has an arc of weight
                    <i>x <sub> 1</sub></i> through <i>x <sub> k</sub></i> to vertex B,
                    and <i>x <sub> 1</sub></i> + <i>x <sub> 2</sub></i> + ... + <i>x
                        <sub> k</sub></i> > 50.

            </ul>

            <p> Find all (a,b) pairs such that a owns b.

            <p> Analysis: This can be solved via an adaptation of the calculating
                the vertices reachable from a vertex in a directed graph.  To
                calculate which vertices vertex A owns, keep track of the "ownership
                percentage" for each node. Initialize them all to zero.  Now, at
                each recursive step, mark the node as owned by vertex A and add
                the weight of all outgoing arcs to the "ownership percentages".
                For all percentages that go above 50, recurse into those vertices.

                <h3>Street Race [IOI 95]</h3>

            <p> Given: a directed graph, and a start point and an end point.

            <p> Find all points p that any path from the start point to the
                end must travel through p.

            <p> Analysis: The easiest algorithm is to remove each point in
                turn, and check to see if the end point is reachable from the start
                point.  This runs in O(N (M + N)) time. Since the original problem
                stated that M &lt;= 100, and N &lt;= 50, this will run in time easily.

                <h3>Cow Tours [1999 USACO National Championship, abridged]</h3>

            <p> The diameter of a connected graph is defined as the maximum
                distance between any two nodes of the graph, where the distance
                between two nodes is defined as the length of the shortest path.

            <p> Given a set of points in the plane, and the connections between
                those points, find the two points which are currently not in the
                same component, such that the diameter of the resulting component
                is minimized.

            <p> Analysis: Find the components of the original graph, using the
                method described above. Then, for each pair of points not in the
                same component, try placing a connection between them. Find the pair that
                minimizes the diameter.

                <h3>Connected Fields</h3>

            <p> Farmer John contracted out the building of a new barn.
                Unfortunately, the builder mixed up the plans of Farmer John's barn
                with another set of plans. Farmer John's plans called for a barn
                that only had one room, but the building he got might have many
                rooms.  Given a grid of the layout of the barn, tell Farmer John
                how many rooms it has.

            <p> Analysis: The graph here is on the non-wall grid locations,
                with edge between adjacent non-wall locations, although the graph
                should be stored as the grid, and not transformed into some other
                form, as the grid is so compact and easy to work with.
