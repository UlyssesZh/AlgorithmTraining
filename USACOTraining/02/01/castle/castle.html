    <h1>Problem: The Castle</h1>
    <b>IOI'94 - Day 1</b>
</div>

<p> In a stroke of luck almost beyond imagination, Farmer John was
    sent a ticket to the Irish Sweepstakes (really a lottery) for his
    birthday.  This ticket turned out to have only the winning number
    for the lottery!  Farmer John won a fabulous castle in the Irish
    countryside.

<p> Bragging rights being what they are in Wisconsin, Farmer John
    wished to tell his cows all about the castle.  He wanted to know
    how many rooms it has and how big the largest room was.  In fact,
    he wants to take out a single wall to make an even bigger room.

<p> Your task is to help Farmer John know the exact room count and
    sizes.

<p>The castle floorplan is divided into M (wide) by N (1 &lt;=M,N&lt;=50)
    square modules.  Each such module can have between zero and four
    walls.  Castles always have walls on their "outer edges" to keep
    out the wind and rain.

<p>Consider this annotated floorplan of a castle:
<pre>
     1   2   3   4   5   6   7
   #############################
 1 #   |   #   |   #   |   |   #
   #####---#####---#---#####---#   
 2 #   #   |   #   #   #   #   #
   #---#####---#####---#####---#
 3 #   |   |   #   #   #   #   #   
   #---#########---#####---#---#
 4 # ->#   |   |   |   |   #   #   
   ############################# 

#  = Wall     -,|  = No wall
-> = Points to the wall to remove to
     make the largest possible new room
</pre>

<p>By way of example, this castle sits on a 7 x 4 base.  A "room" includes
    any set of connected "squares" in the floor plan.  This floorplan contains
    five rooms (whose sizes are 9, 7, 3, 1, and 8 in no particular order).

<p>Removing the wall marked by the arrow merges a pair of rooms to
    make the largest possible room that can be made by removing a single
    wall.

<p> The castle always has at least two rooms and always has a wall
    that can be removed.

<h3>PROGRAM NAME: castle</h3>

<h3>INPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The map is stored in the form of numbers, one number for each
    module ("room"), M numbers on each of N lines to describe the
    floorplan.  The input order corresponds to the numbering in the
    example diagram above.

<p>Each module descriptive-number tells which of the four walls exist and
    is the sum of up to four integers:
<ul>
    <li>1: wall to the west </li>
    <li>2: wall to the north </li>
    <li>4: wall to the east </li>
    <li>8: wall to the south </li>
</ul>
<p>Inner walls are defined twice; a wall to the south in module 1,1
    is also indicated as a wall to the north in module 2,1.

<table>
    <tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> Two space-separated integers: M and N</td>
    <tr> <td> Line 2..: </td> <td>M x N integers, several per line.
    </td>
</table>

<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file castle.in) </h3>

<pre>
7 4
11 6 11 6 3 10 6
7 9 6 13 5 15 5
1 10 12 7 13 7 5
13 11 10 8 10 12 13
</pre>

<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT</h3>

<p>The output contains several lines:
<table>
    <tr> <td> Line 1: </td> <td> The number of rooms the castle has.
    <tr> <td> Line 2: </td> <td> The size of the largest room</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td> Line 3: </td> <td> The size of the largest room creatable by removing one wall
    </td>
    <tr> <td> Line 4: </td> <td> The single wall to remove to make the
        largest room possible</td> </tr>
</table>
<p>Choose the optimal wall to remove from the set of optimal walls
    by choosing the module farthest to the west (and then, if still
    tied, farthest to the south). If still tied, choose 'N' before 'E'.
    Name that wall by naming the module that borders it on either the
    west or south, along with a direction of N or E giving the location
    of the wall with respect to the module.

<h3>INPUT DETAILS</h3>

<p>First, the map is partitioned like below.  Note that walls not on
    the outside borders are doubled:
<pre>
     1    2    3    4    5    6    7

   ####|####|####|####|####|####|#####
</pre>
<p>Let's talk about the squares with a (row, column) notation such that
    the lower right corner is denoted (4, 7).

<p>The input will have four lines, each with 7 numbers. Each number
    describes one 'room'.

<p>>Walls further toward the top are 'north', towards the bottom are 'south',
    towards the left are 'west', and towards the right are 'east'.

<p>Consider square (1,1) which has three walls: north, south, and west.
    To encode those three walls, we consult the chart:
<ul>
    <li>1: wall to the west </li>
    <li>2: wall to the north </li>
    <li>4: wall to the east </li>
    <li>8: wall to the south </li>
</ul>
and sum the numbers for north (2), south (8), and west (1).  2 + 8
+ 1 = 11, so this room is encoded as 11.

<p>The next room to the right (1,2) has walls on the north (2) and
    east (4) and thus is encoded as 2 +4 = 6.

<p>The next room to the right (1,3) is the same as (1,1) and thus encodes as 11.

<p>Room (1,4) is the same as (1,2) and thus encodes as 6.

<p>Room (1,5) has rooms on the west (1) and north (2) and thus encodes
    as 1 + 2 = 3.

<p>Room (1,6) has rooms on the north (2) and south (8) and thus encodes
    as 2 + 8 = 10.

<p>Room (1,7) is the same as room (1,2) and thus encodes as 6.

<p>This same method continues for rooms (2,1) through (4,7).
