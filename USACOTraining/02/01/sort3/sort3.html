    <h1>Problem: Sorting a Three-Valued Sequence </h1>
    <b>IOI'96 - Day 2</b>
</div>

<p> Sorting is one of the most frequently performed computational tasks.
    Consider the special sorting problem in which the records to be sorted
    have at most<I> three</I> different key values. This happens for instance
    when we sort medalists of a competition according to medal value, that
    is, gold medalists come first, followed by silver, and bronze medalists
    come last.

<P> In this task the possible key values are the integers 1, 2 and 3.
    The required sorting order is non-decreasing. However, sorting has to
    be accomplished by a sequence of exchange operations. An exchange
    operation, defined by two position numbers p and q, exchanges the elements
    in positions p and q.

<P> You are given a sequence of key values. Write a program that computes
    the minimal number of exchange operations that are necessary to make
    the sequence sorted.
