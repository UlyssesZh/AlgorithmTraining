<div style="text-align: center;"><h1>Analysis: Subset Sums</h1>
<b>Rob Kolstad</b></div>
<p>This is a classic dynamic programming problem.

<p>The basis of a handful of DP algorithms is the "take-an-old-count,
	add some to it, and carry it forward again".  Subset sums is
	a classic example of this.

<p>First, let's rephrase the task as, "Given N, calculate the total
	number a partition must sum to {n*(n+1)/2 /2}, and find the
	number of ways to form that sum by adding 1, 2, 3, ... N."

<p>Thus, for N=7, the entire set of numbers 1..7 sums to 7*8/2 which
	is 56/2=28. And, if we partitioned that into two equal-sum sets,
	they'd pretty much have to sum to ** 14 **.

<p>Now comes the 'DP trick' *for this class of DP tasks*. We'll set up
	a little one-dimensional array called... 'buckets'. In this array reside
	the counts of ways you can build various numbers given a set
	of numbers 1.. m.  Thus, over time, buckets looks like this:

<pre>Lev::   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11  ...
  1::   1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  ...
  2::   1  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  ...
  3::   1  1  1  2  1  1  1  0  0  0  0  0  ...
  4::   1  1  1  2  2  2  2  2  1  1  1  0  ...</pre>

<p>If we look at row 1::, we see "There is 1 way to make a 0 and
	one way to build a 1 using the set {1}"

<p>If we look at row 2::, we see "There is 1 way to make a 0 (this
	is always true), one way to make a 1, one way to make a 2,
	and one way to make a 3" -- the 3 is from 1 + 2

<p>If we look at row 3::, we see: "... *two* ways to make a 3 ...". Since
	you can make a 3 with: 3 or 1+2, now we're seeing some growth.

<p>Row 4:: says "... two ways for a 3, two ways for a 4, two ways for a 5,
	two ways for a 6, two ways for a 7, ..." and one way for many others.

<p>We calculate row N+1 from row N.

<p>For each bucket j in our set:

<pre>newbucket[j + added_number] += olderbucket[j]</pre>

<p>So if the added_number is 3, and you're processing column 4,
<pre>
newbucket [4 + 3] += olderbucket[4]
</pre>
which is to say, "With a 3 in our hand, realize we can create
a 7 by olderbucket[4] ways" and mark that down.

<p>The above sentence is the key.  Once you see that, everything
	becomes clear.

<p>The answer is found for N=7 by looking in bucket 14 and dividing
	the answer by 2, since we count each partitioning twice (once in
	each of two orderings).

<p>Hal Burch's solution is shown below.
<pre>

/* Calculate how many two-way partitions of {1, 2, ..., N} are
   even splits (the sums of the elements of both partition are equal) */

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#define MAXSUM 637

unsigned int numsets[637][51];

int max;
unsigned int sum;

main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  int lv, lv2, lv3;
  int cnt;
  FILE *fin, *fout;

  fin = fopen ("subset.in", "r");
  fscanf(fin, "%d", &amp;max);
  fclose (fin);
  fout = fopen("subset.out", "w");

  if ((max % 4) == 1 || (max % 4) == 2) {
    fprintf (stderr, "0\n");
    exit(1);
  }

  sum = max * (max+1) / 4;

    memset(numsets, 0, sizeof(numsets[0]));
    numsets[0][0] = 1;
    for (lv = 1; lv &lt; max; lv++) {
      for (lv2 = 0; lv2 &lt;= sum; lv2++)
        numsets[lv2][lv] = numsets[lv2][lv-1];
      for (lv2 = 0; lv2 &lt;= sum-lv; lv2++)
        numsets[lv2+lv][lv] += numsets[lv2][lv-1];
    }

    fprintf (fout, "%u\n", numsets[sum][max-1]);
    fclose (fout);
  exit (0);
}
</pre>
and here's an even more concise solution from Nick Tomitov of Bulgaria:
<pre>
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
using namespace std;
const unsigned int MAX_SUM = 1024;
int n;
unsigned long long int dyn[MAX_SUM];
ifstream fin ("subset.in");
ofstream fout ("subset.out");

int main() {
    fin &gt;&gt; n;
    fin.close();
    int s = n*(n+1);
    if (s % 4) {
        fout &lt;&lt; 0 &lt;&lt; endl;
        fout.close ();
        return ;
    }
    s /= 4;
    int i, j;
    dyn [0] = 1;
    for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
        for (j = s; j &gt;= i; j--)
            dyn[j] += dyn[j-i];
    fout &lt;&lt; (dyn[s]/2) &lt;&lt; endl;
    fout.close();
    return 0;
}
</pre>
