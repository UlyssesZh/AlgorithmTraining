<h3>Prerequisite </h3>
	<ul>

	</ul>
	
	<h3>How to pick the perfect data structure</h3>
		
		<p>
			There are several aspect of data structures to consider
			when selecting the proper way to represent the data for a
			problem.
		
		<h5>Will it work?</h5>
		
		<p>
			If the data struct won't work, it's not helpful at all.  Ask yourself
			what questions the algorithm will need to be able to ask the data
			structure, and make sure the data structure can handle it.  If not,
			then either more data must be added to the structure, or you need
			to find a different representation.
		
		<h5>Can I code it?</h5>
		
		<p> If you don't know or can't remember how to code a given data
			structure, pick a different one.  Make sure that you have a good idea
			how each of the operations will affect the structure of the data.
		
		<p> Another consideration here is memory.  Will the data structure fit
			in the available memory?  If not, compact it or pick a new one.
			Otherwise, it is already clear from the beginning that it won't work.
		
		<h5>Can I Code It In Time?</h5>
		
		<p> As this is a timed contest, you have three to five programs to write
			in five hours.  If it'll take you an hour and a half to code just the
			data structure for the first problem, then you're almost certainly
			looking at the wrong structure.
		
		<h5>Can I Debug It?</h5>
		
		<p> It is easy to forget this particular aspect of data structure
			selection.  Remember that a program is useless unless it works.  Don't
			forget that debugging time is a large portion of the contest time, so
			include its consideration in calculating coding time.
		
		<p> What makes a data structure easy to debug?  That is basically
			determined by the following two properties.
		
		<ul>
			
			<li>
				<b>State Is Easy To Examine</b>
				The smaller, more compact the representation, in general, the easier
				it is to examine.  Also, statically allocated arrays are <b>much</b>
				easier to examine than linked lists or even dynamically allocated
				arrays. </li>
			
			<li>
				<b>State can Be Displayed Easily</b>
				For the more complex data structures, the easiest way to examine
				them is to write a small routine to output the data.  Unfortunately,
				given time constraints, you'll probably want to limit yourself
				to text output.  This means that structures like trees and graphs
				are going to be difficult to examine.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Is It Fast?</h5>
		
		<p> This is, surprisingly, the least important consideration when picking
			a data structure.  A slow program will normally get a noticeable portion
			of the points, but a fast, incorrect one will not, unless it gets lucky.
		
		<h5>Conclusion</h5>
		
		<p> In general, remember the KISS principle: "Keep It Simple, Stupid."
			Sometimes more complexity is very helpful, but make sure you're getting
			your money's worth.  Remember that taking the time to make sure you've
			got the correct data structure at the start is a lot less expensive than
			having to replace a data structure later.
			
			<h3>Things to Avoid: Dynamic Memory</h3>
		
		<p>
			In general, you should avoid dynamic memory, because:
		
		<center><b>It Is Too Easy To Make Mistakes Using Dynamic Memory</b></center>
		
		<p>
			Overwriting past allocated memory, not freeing memory, and not allocating
			memory are only some of the mistakes that are introduced when dynamic
			memory is used.  In addition, the failure modes for these errors are
			such that it's hard to tell where the error occurred, as it's likely to
			be at a (potentially much later) memory operation.
		
		<p><center><b>It Is Too Hard To Examine the Data Structure's Contents</b></center>
		
		<p>The interactive development environments available don't handle
			dynamic memory well, especially for C.
		
		<p> Consider parallel arrays as an alternative to dynamic memory.  One
			way to do a linked list, where instead of keeping a next point, you keep
			a second array, which has the index of the next element.  Sometimes you
			may have to dynamically allocate these, but as it should only be done
			once, it's much easier to get right than allocating and freeing the
			memory for each insert and delete.
		
		<p> All of this notwithstanding, sometimes dynamic memory is the way to
			go, especially for large data structures where the size of the structure
			is not known until you have the input.
			
			<h3> Things to Avoid: Coolness Factor </h3>
		
		<p>
			Try not to fall into the "coolness" trap.  You may have just
			seen the neatest data structure, but remember:
		
		<ul>
			
			<li><b>Cool ideas that don't work aren't.  </b></li>
			
			<li><b>Cool ideas that'll take forever to code aren't, either</b></li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<p>
			It's much more important that your data structure and program work
			than how impressive your data structure is.
			
			<h3>Basic Structures</h3>
		
		<p>
			There are five basic data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks,
			queues, and deque (pronounced deck).  You might have seen these structures
			before. If you have not, consult Sedgewick for what they are.
		
		<h5>Binary Search Trees</h5>
		
		<p> Binary search trees enable you to search a collection of objects
			(each with a real or integer value) quickly to determine if a given
			value exists in the collection.
		
		<p> Basically, a binary search tree is a weighted, rooted binary ordered
			tree. That collection of adjectives means that each node in the tree
			might have one 'right' child and one 'left' child (but both or either
			could be missing).  In addition, each node has an object associated with
			it, and the 'weight' of the node is the value of the object.
		
		<p> The binary search tree also has the property that each node's left
			child and descendants of its left child have a value less than that of
			the node, and each node's right child and its descendants have a value
			greater or equal to it.
			
			<br><img src="ds.bst.gif"><br>
		
		<p> The nodes are generally represented as a structure with four fields,
			a pointer to the node's left child, a pointer to the node's right child,
			the weight of the object stored at this node, and a pointer to the object
			itself.
		
		<h5>Why Are Binary Search Trees Useful?</h5>
		
		<p> Given a collection of N objects, a binary search tree takes only
			O(log N) time to find an objects, assuming that the tree is not really
			poor (a tree where each node has no left child means the search will
			take O(N) time, for example).  In addition, unlike just keeping a sorted
			array, inserting and deleting objects only takes log N time as well.
		
		<h5>Variations on Binary Trees</h5>
		
		<p> Sometimes it's helpful to provide a link to a node's parent as
			well.
		
		<p> There are several variants that ensure that the trees are never
			poor.  Splay trees, Red-black trees, Treaps, B-trees, and AVL trees are
			some of the more common examples.  They are all much more complicated
			to code, and random trees are generally good, so it's generally not worth
			it.
		
		<p> If you're concerned that the tree you created might be bad (it's
			being created by inserting elements from an input file, for example),
			then randomly order the elements before insertion.
		
		<h5>Hash Tables</h5>
		
		A hash table stores data with a very quick way to do lookups. Let's say
		there is a collection of objects and a data structure must quickly answer
		the question:  "Is this object in the data structure?" (e.g., is this
		word in the dictionary?).  A hash table does this in less time than it
		takes to do binary search.
		
		<p> The idea is this: find a function that maps the elements of the
			collection to an integer between 1 and x (where x, in this explanation, is
			larger than the number of elements in your collection).  Keep an array
			indexed from 1 to x, and store each element at the position that the
			function evaluates the element as. Then, to determine if something is in
			your collection, just plug it into the function and see whether or not that
			position is empty. If it is not check the element there to see if it is
			the same as the something you're holding,
		
		<p> For example, presume the function is defined over 3-character words,
			and is (first letter + (second letter * 3) + (third letter * 7)) mod 11
			(A=1, B=2, etc.), and the words are "CAT", "CAR", and "COB". When
			using ASCII, this function takes "CAT" and maps it to 3, maps "CAR" to
			0, and maps "COB" to 7, so the hash table would look like this:
			
			<pre>
0:&nbsp;CAR
1
2
3:&nbsp;CAT
4
5
6
7:&nbsp;COB
8
9
10
</pre>
		
		<p>Now, to see if "BAT" is in the table, plug it into the hash function
			to get 2. This position in the hash table is empty, so it is not in the
			collection. "ACT", on the other hand, returns the value 7, so the program
			must check to see if that entry, "COB", is the same as "ACT".
		
		<p>Consider this function:
		<pre>
#define NHASH 8999           /* make sure this is prime! */

hashnum(p)
char *p;
{
    unsigned int sum = 0;
    for ( ; *p; p++) {
	sum = (sum << 3) + *p;
		// some folks add: if (sum < 0) sum = -sum;
    }
    return sum % NHASH;
}
</pre>
		
		<p>This function will return *some* integer in the range 0..NHASH-1
			for every input.  As it turns out, the output is fairly random.  It
			is important (for this simple function) for NHASH to be prime.
			Combine the above with a main program:
		<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

main() {
    FILE *in;
    char line[100], *p;
    in = fopen ("/usr/share/dict/words", "r");
    while (fgets (line, 100, in)) {
	for (p = line; *p; p++)
	    if (*p == '\n') { *p = '\0'; break; }
	printf("%6d %s\n", hashnum(line), line);
    }
    exit (0);
}
</pre>
		to yield numbers like this for the (start of the) english dictionary:
		<pre>
  4645 aback
  4678 abaft
  6495 abandon
  2634 abandoned
  4810 abandoning
   142 abandonment
  7080 abandons
  4767 abase
  2240 abased
  7076 abasement
  4026 abasements
  2255 abases
  4770 abash
   222 abashed
   237 abashes
  2215 abashing
   361 abasing
  4775 abate
  2304 abated
  3848 abatement
   ... ...
</pre>
		<p> You can see that the function yields numbers that are all different
			and are fairly random looking, at least in this small sample.
		
		<p> Of course, if one has NHASH+1 words, the pigeon-hole principle says
			that at least one pair of them will yield the same function value.  This
			is called a 'collision'.  Pragmatic hash tables use a list of length NHASH
			to represent the head of NHASH linked lists of words that all hashed to
			the same value.
		
		<p>
			Let's see how hashing is really used.  First, start with a structure
			that forms a linked list off the hash table.  The linked list structure
			looks like this:
		<pre>
struct hash_f {
    struct hash_f *h_next;
    char *h_string;
    int   h_value;   /* some value associated with the string */
               /* completely optional how it's used or even if it's present */
};

struct hash_f *hashtable[NHASH];      /* the head of each linked list */
                        /* automatically set to NULL since it's global */
</pre>
		
		<p>This makes a hash table that would look like this if two
			elements were present:
		<pre>
       hashtable        *hash_f           *hash_f
     +------------+
   0 |            |  +-----------+    +-----------+
     +------------+  |          *|-+  |          0|
   1 |            |  +-----------+ |  +-----------+
     +------------+  | 'string1' | |  | 'abc def' |
   2 |          * |->+-----------+ +->+-----------+
     +------------+  | val=1234  |    | val=43225 |
   3 |            |  +-----------+    +-----------+
     +------------+
    ...
8998 |            |
     +------------+
</pre>
		<p>Here's hashinsert:
		<pre>
struct hash_f *
hashinsert(p, val)
char *p;
int val;
{
    int n = hashnum(p);				/* where in table? */
    struct hash_f *h = malloc( sizeof (struct hash_f) ); /* make a new hash element */

/* link into start of list: */
    h->h_next = hashtable[n];
    hashtable[n] = h;

/* optional value: */
    h->h_val = val;

/* so we can later find the proper element in this chain: */
    h->h_string = malloc( strlen(p) + 1 );
    strcpy (h->h_string, p);

    return h;
}
</pre>
		
		And here's hashlookup (which will return a pointer to the hash
		structure if it's found):
		<pre>
struct hash_f *
hashlookup(p) {
    struct hash_f *h;

    int n = hashnum(p);				/* where to start looking */

    for (h = hashtable[n]; h; h=h->h_next)	/* traverse linked list */
	if (0 == strcmp (p, h->h_string))	/* string match? done! */
	    return h;
    return 0;					/* didn't find target */
}
</pre>
		<p>Now you can insert strings quickly and look them up quickly, in
			size_of_linked_list/2 string compares, on average.
		
		<h5>Why Are Hash Tables Useful?</h5>
		
		<p> Hash tables enable, with a little bit of memory cost, programs to
			perform lookups with almost constant work.  Generally, the program must
			evaluate the function and then possibly compare the looked up element to
			an entry or a few entries in the table.
		
		<h5>Hashers</h5>
		
		<p> A more subtle, and often forgotten, technique to avoid collisions is
			to pick a good hash function. For example, taking the three letter prefix
			as the hash value for a dictionary would be very bad. Under this hash
			function, the prefix "CON" would have a huge number of entries. Pick a
			function where two elements are unlikely to map to the same value:
		<ul>
			<li>Create a relatively huge value and mod it with the size of your table
				(this works especially well if your hash table is a prime size).</li>
			
			<li> Primes are your friends. Multiply by them. </li>
			
			<li>Try to have small changes map to completely different locations.</li>
			
			<li> You don't want to have two small changes cancel each other out in your
				mapping function (a transposition, for example). </li>
			
			<li> This is a whole field of study, and you could create a "Perfect Hash
				Function" that would give you no collisions, but, for your purposes,
				that's entirely too much work. Pick something that seems fairly random,
				and see if it works; it probably will.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h5>Hash Table Variations</h5>
		
		<p> It is often quite useful to store more information that just the value.
			One example is when searching a small subset of a large subset, and using
			the hash table to store locations visited, you may want the value for
			searching a location in the hash table with it.
		
		<p> Even a small hash table can improve runtime by drastically reducing
			your search space.  For example, keeping a dictionary hashed by the first
			letter means that if you wanted to search for a word, you would only be
			looking at words that have the same first letter.
			
			<h3>Special Trees Called 'Tries'</h3>
				
				<br><img src="ds1.gif"><br>
		
		<p>A trie is, in short, a rooted tree. It has unbounded out-degree (a
			node may logically have any number of children). The children of a node
			are stored in a linked list, so each node has two pointers, next sibling
			and first child.
		
		<p>
			Tries store a collection of sequences.  Every path from the root to a
			leaf specifies an element of that collection.  For example, for the trie
			illustrated, the collection specified is "CAR", "CAT", and "COB",
			presuming no other nodes exist.
		
		<p> To determine if a sequence is in the collection, start at the root,
			search through its children for the first element of that sequence.  If
			no match is found, the sequence is not in the collection.  Otherwise,
			search the children of that node similarly and for subsequent element.
		
		<p>Tries have several nice features. Checking to see if an element is
			in the list takes time bounded by the length of the sequence times the
			maximum number of children a node has.  Additionally, this data structure
			can often use less memory than other representations, because prefixes
			only appear once (in our example, there is only one 'CA' node even though
			'CAR' and 'CAT' appear).
		
		<p>In general, a trie is nice to use when you want to ask this question
			a lot:  Does there exist a sequence (word, multi-digit number, or other
			type) that starts with this?
		
		<h5>Trie Variations</h5>
		
		<p>
			Some common slight alterations to tries are:
		
		<ul>
			
			<li> If your list may contain two words, one of which is a prefix of
				the other, you have to add a flag at each node which says "A word ends
				here." For example, if you wanted to also have "CA" in your trie, it
				would have to be flagged.</li>
			
			<li> It sometimes helps to keep the linked list of children in sorted
				order.  This increases the time to build the trie, but decreases the
				time to search it.</li>
			
			<li> If you have many words with similar prefixes but unique endings,
				it is sometimes helpful to put "special" nodes that stand for a sequence
				themselves. For example, if you want to represent "CARTING,"
				"COBBLER," and "CATCHING," memory constraints may make it more
				reasonable to represent a "RTING," "BBLER," and "TCHING" node.
				Note that this increases the complexity dramatically.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Heap</h3>
			
			<p> A heap (sometimes called a priority queue) is a complete binary tree
				in which every node's value is less than both of its children's values:
				<br><img src="ds2.gif"><br>
			
			<h5>Heap Representation</h5>
			
			<p> If the tree is filled in from left to right level by level (that
				is, the tree is complete except for its lowest level, on which the
				elements are filled in from left to right), then the heap can be stored
				in an array, which is just the top level from left to right, the second
				level, and so on.
			
			<p>
				The heap given would be:
				<pre>
3&nbsp;5&nbsp;9&nbsp;6&nbsp;12&nbsp;13&nbsp;10&nbsp;8&nbsp;11
</pre>
			
			<p> In this representation, the children of the node at position x are
				2x and 2x+1 (assuming 1 based indexing), and the parent of x is
				truncate(x/2).
			
			<h5>How Do I Add And Remove things To A Heap?</h5>
			
			<p> To add an element, put it at the end of the array. Now, as long as
				it's below its current parent, swap it with its parent. For example, to
				add the number 4, the heap array would go through the following states:
				<br>
				<pre>
&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;12&nbsp;13&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;4
&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;13&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;11&nbsp;12
&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;13&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;11&nbsp;12
</pre>
			
			<p> Deleting an element is also relatively easy. Take the last element
				in the array and replace the element you wish to delete with it. While
				one of its children is less than it, pick the smaller of the two and
				swap with it. For example, to delete 3:
				
				<br>
				<pre>
11&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;12&nbsp;13&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;8
&nbsp;5&nbsp;11&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;12&nbsp;13&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;8
&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;11&nbsp;12&nbsp;13&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;8
&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;8&nbsp;12&nbsp;13&nbsp;10&nbsp;11
</pre>
			
			<h5>What If I Want To Alter A Value?</h5>
			
			<p>
				To alter a value upwards, change the value, and swap with its
				parents as long as necessary.
			
			<p>
				To alter a value downwards, change the value, and swap with the smaller of
				its two children as long as necessary.
			
			<h5>Why Would I Use This?</h5>
			
			<p> A heap makes it very easy to ask the question "What's the smallest
				thing?" in a collection of dynamic values. It's a compact representation
				and quick to compute. An example of a location where this can be helpful
				is Dijkstra's algorithm.
			
			<h5>Heap Variations</h5>
			
			<p> In this representation, just the weight was kept. Usually you want
				more data than that, so you can either keep that data and move it (if
				it's small) or keep pointers to the data.
			
			<p> Since when you want to fiddle with values, the first thing you have
				to do is find the location of the value you wish to alter, it's
				often helpful to keep that data around. (e.g., node x is represented
				in location 16 of the heap).
